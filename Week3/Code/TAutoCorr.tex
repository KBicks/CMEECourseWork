   	\section{Analysis and Results}
   	\paragraph{}To analyse the correlation in temperature change over successive years of the 20th century, data was matched and the initial correlation calculated. The data was then randomly sampled and correlation calculated over 10000 iterations. The p-value was then calculated using the proportion of correlations above the original value, 0.326. This gave a value of p $<$ 0.001, indicating that there was a significant correlation in temperature change over successive years, when compared to a random sample of years. 
   	
   	\paragraph{}These results indicate that temperature has changed successively over time. The correlation between successive years was a weak positive trend, indicating that the temperature has increased during the 20th century in Key West, Florida.
