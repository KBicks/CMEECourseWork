### CMEE Coursework Week 3 README

*Introduction:* This directory contains coursework files from week 1 of the CMEE course. This week included an introduction to R and data management, exploration and visualisation using R. Some scripts used to run R scripts are written in bash and written analysis has been carried out in LaTeX.

*Contents:* There are three directories:
1. **Code** - script files in R, bash and LaTeX.
2. **Data** - data used to test code scripts.
3. **Results** - location for output files produced by script files.

*Code File Descriptions:*

Biological Computing in R:
**sample.R** - Exemplifies generating a vector of 100 random values using a function and the command 'sample()', then how to run function using vectorization or a for loop. 
**basic_io.R** - Demonstrating input and output of csv files, including appending.
**boilerplate.R** - A boilerplate script exemplifying printing arguments and their type in R.
**control.R** - Demonstrating use of control flows, using if, else and while statements, and for loops.
**break.R** - Exemplifying use of 'break' in while, if and else statements.
**next.R** - Exemplifying use of 'next' in a for loop, with an if statement.


Biological Computing in R Practicals:
**TreeHeight.R** - Calculates tree height from the angle to top and distance from base, and saves calculated values in csv with original data.
**get_TreeHeight.R** - Calculates tree height from the angle to top and distance from base, and saves calculated values in csv with original data, takes data file from command line, and outputs to results.
**run_get_TreeHeight.sh** - Runs get_TreeHeight.sh, using trees.csv as the input file.
