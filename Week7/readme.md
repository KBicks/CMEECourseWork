### CMEE Coursework Week 7 README

*Introduction:* This directory contains coursework files from week 7 of the CMEE course. This week furthered exploration of python and applied it to more complex models.  
  
*Contents:* There are three directories:
1. **Code** - script files in python, R and bash.
2. **Data** - data used to test code scripts.
3. **Results** - location for output files produced by script files.

*Code File Descriptions:*  
Biological Computing in Python 2:  
**profileme.py** - Exemplifies profiling in python.  
**profileme2.py** - Profiling in python, same as profileme.py but using list comprehensions instead of for loops.  
**timeitme.py** - Comparison of time taken for a loop and list comprehension to run the same function, outputs average times taken for function compared.  
**regexs.py** - Exemplifies use of regular expressions in python.  
  
Biological Computing in Python 2 Practicals:  
**LV1.py** - Continuous time Lotka-Volterra model showing population densities for  resources and consumers, over a set time period. Outputs figures showing the variation in population densities over time and a phase portrait for the system.  
**LV2.py** - Continuous time Lotka-Volterra model showing population densities for resources and consumers, over a set time period, including carrying capacity. Outputs figures showing the variation in population densities over time and a phase portrait for the system.  
**run_LV.sh** - Runs Lotka-Volterra simulations in python.  
**DrawFW.py** - Plots a foodweb network, with specified values initial values of species number and probability of interactions. Plots a network to pdf.  
**blackbirds.py** - Searches and extracts Kingdom, Phylum and Species from a text file into a string.  
**using_os.py** - Searches home directory for files and directories starting with c, both upper and lower case.  
**fmr.R** - Plots metabolic rate against body mass for the Nagy et al 1999 dataset.  
**run_fmr_R.py** -Exemplifies running an R script using python.
