abstract = {Given the importance of knowledge of species distribution for conservation and climate change management, continuous and progressive evaluation of the statistical models predicting species distributions is necessary. Current models are evaluated in terms of ecological theory used, the data model accepted and the statistical methods applied. Focus is restricted to Generalised Linear Models (GLM) and Generalised Additive Models (GAM). Certain currently unused regression methods are reviewed for their possible application to species modelling. A review of recent papers suggests that ecological theory is rarely explicitly considered. Current theory and results support species responses to environmental variables to be unimodal and often skewed though process-based theory is often lacking. Many studies fail to test for unimodal or skewed responses and straight-line relationships are often fitted without justification. Data resolution (size of sampling unit) determines the nature of the environmental niche models that can be fitted. A synthesis of differing ecophysiological ideas and the use of biophysical processes models could improve the selection of predictor variables. A better conceptual framework is needed for selecting variables. Comparison of statistical methods is difficult. Predictive success is insufficient and a test of ecological realism is also needed. Evaluation of methods needs artificial data, as there is no knowledge about the true relationships between variables for field data. However, use of artificial data is limited by lack of comprehensive theory. Three potentially new methods are reviewed. Quantile regression (QR) has potential and a strong theoretical justification in Liebig's law of the minimum. Structural equation modelling (SEM) has an appealing conceptual framework for testing causality but has problems with curvilinear relationships. Geographically weighted regression (GWR) intended to examine spatial non-stationarity of ecological processes requires further evaluation before being used. Synthesis and applications: explicit theory needs to be incorporated into species response models used in conservation. For example, testing for unimodal skewed responses should be a routine procedure. Clear statements of the ecological theory used, the nature of the data model and sufficient details of the statistical method are needed for current models to be evaluated. New statistical methods need to be evaluated for compatibility with ecological theory before use in applied ecology. Some recent work with artificial data suggests the combination of ecological knowledge and statistical skill is more important than the precise statistical method used. The potential exists for a synthesis of current species modelling approaches based on their differing ecological insights not their methodology. Crown Copyright {\textcopyright} 2006.},

abstract = {Neglect of ecological knowledge is a limiting factor in the use of statistical modelling to predict species distribution. Three components are needed for statistical modelling, an ecological model concerning the ecological theory to be used or tested, a data model concerning the collection and measurement of the data, and a statistical model concerning the statistical theory and methods used. This component framework is reviewed with emphasis on ecological theory. The expected shape of a species response curve to an environmental gradient is a central assumption on which agreement has yet to be reached. The nature of the environmental predictors whether indirect variables, e.g. latitude that have no physiological impact on plants, or direct variables, e.g. temperature also influence the type of response expected. Straight-line relationships between organisms and environment are often used uncritically. Many users of canonical correlation analysis use linear (straight-line) functions to relate ordination axes to variables such as slope and aspect though this is not a necessary part of the method. Some statisticians have used straight lines for species/environment relationships without testing, when evaluating new statistical procedures. Assumptions used in one component often conflict with those in another component. Statistical models can be used to explore ecological theory. Skewed species response curves predominate contrary to the symmetric unimodal curves assumed by some statistical methods. Improvements in statistical modelling can be achieved based on ecological concepts. Examples include incorporating interspecific competition from dominant species; more proximal predictors based on water balance models and spatial autocorrelation procedures to accommodate non-equilibrium vegetation.},

abstract = {Knowledge of relationships between predator size and prey size are needed to describe interactions of species and size classes in food webs. Most estimates of predator and prey sizes have been based on dietary studies and apply to small numbers of species in a relatively narrow size range. These estimates may or may not be representative of values for other groups of species and body sizes or for other locations. Marine predator and prey size data associated with published literature were identified and collated to produce a single data set. If predator or prey length of mass were not measured in the original study, the length or mass was calculated using length-mass relationships. The data set consists of 34931 records from 27 locations covering a wide range of environmental conditions from the tropics to the poles and for 93 types of predator with sizes ranging from 0.1 mg to over 415 kg and 174 prey types with sizes from 75 pg to over 4.5 kg. Each record includes: predator and prey scientific names, common names, taxa, life stages and sizes (length and mass with conversion details), plus the type of feeding interaction, geographic location (with habitat description, latitude, longitude) and mean annual environ mental data (sea surface temperature and primary productivity).},

abstract = {Based on geographical and home range sizes, physiology, and gape limitation, a positive relationship between predator size and diet breadth is expected. Alternatively, larger predators might avoid smaller prey; in this case no relationship would be found. Here, I used a large data set on the diets of marine predators to describe and identify mechanisms responsible for the relationships among predator body size, diet breadth, and the mean, minimum, maximum, and variance of prey size. I found no relationship between predator size and diet breadth. Mean, minimum, maximum, and variance of prey size were all positively associated with predator size. I found that larger predators increase their minimum and maximum prey size with similar slopes, which explains the lack of relationship between predator size and diet breadth. The results support predictions of the hypothesis that optimal foraging is the main factor constraining the shape of the relationships among predator size, prey size, and diet breadth. Future research should focus on examining the relationship between body size and the breadth of different niche axis across different groups of organisms to assess whether a positive relationship between body size and niche breadth is a general rule in macroecology.},

In cases in which the outcome variable is a count with a low arithmetic mean (typically {\textless} 10), standard ordinary least squares regression may produce biased results. We provide an introduction to regression models that provide appropriate analyses for count data. We introduce standard Poisson regression with an example and discuss its interpretation. Two variants of Poisson regression, overdispersed Poisson regression and negative binomial regression, are introduced that may provide more optimal results when a key assumption of standard Poisson regression is violated. We also discuss the problems of excess zeros in which a subgroup of respondents who would never display the behavior are included in the sample and truncated zeros in which respondents who have a zero count are excluded by the sampling plan. We provide computer syntax for our illustrations in SAS and SPSS. The Poisson family of regression models provides improved and now easy to implement analyses of count data.

abstract = {Recently, researchers in several areas of ecology and evolution have begun to change the way in which they analyze data and make biological inferences. Rather than the traditional null hypothesis testing approach, they have adopted an approach called model selection, in which several competing hypotheses are simultaneously confronted with data. Model selection can be used to identify a single best model, thus lending support to one particular hypothesis, or it can be used to make inferences based on weighted support from a complete set of competing models. Model selection is widely accepted and well developed in certain fields, most notably in molecular systematics and mark-recapture analysis. However, it is now gaining support in several other areas, from molecular evolution to landscape ecology. Here, we outline the steps of model selection and highlight several ways that it is now being implemented. By adopting this approach, researchers in ecology and evolution will find a valuable alternative to traditional null hypothesis testing, especially when more than one hypothesis is plausible.},

abstract = {The size and growth of the human population are often cited as key factors in threats to Earth's biodiversity, yet the extent of their contribution to the endangerment and extinction of other species has remained unclear. Moreover, it could be valuable to know what additional threats may arise from continued human population growth. Here we quantify a model of the relationship between human population density and the number of threatened mammal and bird species by nation. Our multiple regression analysis revealed that two predictor variables, human population density and species richness (of birds and mammals), account for 88{\%} of the variability in log-transformed densities of threatened species across 114 continental nations. Using the regression model with projected population sizes of each nation, we found that the number of threatened species in the average nation is expected to increase 7{\%} by 2020, and 14{\%} by 2050, as forecast by human population growth alone. Our findings strongly support the notion that abating human population growth is a necessary, if not sufficient, step in the epic attempt to conserve biodiversity on the global scale. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {We utilized a long-term data base collected over a broad geographic range to examine predator size-prey size relationships for 18 species of marine fish predators from continental shelf waters off the northeast US coast. Regression analysis was used to illustrate interspecific variation in ontogenetic patterns of prey size use, gape allometries, and ratio-based trophic niche breadths. Size-based feeding strategies were assessed through comparison of frequency distributions of relative prey sizes eaten and were related to general predator feeding tactics and gape morphology. The results demonstrated that the range of prey sizes eaten expanded with increasing predator body size for each of the marine predators examined, leading to asymmetric predator size-prey size distributions. Absolute maximum prey size and slopes of maximum prey size versus predator size varied widely among predator taxa. Distinct size-based feeding strategies were evident, as diets of some predators were dominated by prey that were 10 to 20{\%} of predator size, whereas other predators frequently consumed prey {\textgreater}50{\%} of predator size. Gape sizes and allometric relationships with body size were also diverse among predators and often were closely associated with maximum prey sizes. Ratio-based trophic-niche breadths generally did not expand with predator ontogeny and tended to narrow for the largest predators, which may be common for animal taxa.},

Prey selection can involve active predator choice or be a passive process. We experimentally studied size-selectivity in pikeperch, feeding on roach and rudd. When given a choice of different prey sizes, pikeperch selected small prey. Passive selection mechanisms ( encounter rate, capture success and satiation) could not fully explain the pattern of diet choice. Instead, behavioural analysis revealed that the pikeperch actively selected small- sized prey. Optimal foraging theory, predicting that predators will choose prey sizes giving highest energy return per time spent foraging, is assumed to explain active choice. We measured handling times for a range of prey sizes and found that the most profitable sizes were also the chosen ones, both in experiments and in the field. This suggests that pikeperch choose their prey to maximise energy intake per unit time.},

abstract = {In an effort to make complex food web relations more tractable, published data on the food habits of terres- trial vertebrate predators were analyzed for patterns in the use of prey by size. Regressions of prey weight on predator weight were run and provided descriptions of both the rela- tionship between mean prey weight and predator weight and the variation in prey weights taken by the predators. Separate models proved necessary for three trophic speciali- zations: insectivores, piscivores and carnivores. Insectivores were found to take proportionately much smaller prey than carnivores. Mean prey weight tends to decrease slightly rela- tive to predator weight among larger insectivores, while the ratio of prey weight to predator weight tends to increase with carnivore size. On average, insectivores also take a relatively wider range of prey sizes than carnivores. In all respects, piscivores were intermediate to insectivores and carnivores. These models produce log-normal approxima- tions to the frequency distributions (by weight) of prey sizes in the ration of predators from knowledge of the predators's body mass. Combined with allometric models of the bioner- getics and productivity of animals, these relations are used to predict that: (1) the daily kill rate declines with predator weight and (2) the upper limit to predator biomass is inde- pendent of predator weight.},

We solve the scaled model of predator-prey dynamics and predict population level characteristics such as the scaling of coexistence size ranges and the optimal predator-prey size ratio. For a broad class of such models, the optimal predator-prey size ratio given available prey of a fixed size is constant. We also demonstrate how scaling predictions of prey density differ under resource limitation vs. predator drawdown. Finally, we show how evolution of predator size can destabilize population dynamics, compare scaling of predator-prey cycles to previous work, as well as discuss possible extensions of the model to multispecies communities.},
