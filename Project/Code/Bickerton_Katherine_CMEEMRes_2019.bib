abstract = {How should ecologists and evolutionary biologists analyze nonnormal data that involve random effects? Nonnormal data such as counts or proportions often defy classical statistical procedures. Generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) provide a more flexible approach for analyzing nonnormal data when random effects are present. The explosion of research on GLMMs in the last decade has generated considerable uncertainty for practitioners in ecology and evolution. Despite the availability of accurate techniques for estimating GLMM parameters in simple cases, complex GLMMs are challenging to fit and statistical inference such as hypothesis testing remains difficult. We review the use (and misuse) of GLMMs in ecology and evolution, discuss estimation and inference and summarize 'best-practice' data analysis procedures for scientists facing this challenge. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Model selection is a topic of special relevance in molecular phylogenetics that affects many, if not all, stages of phylogenetic inference. Here we discuss some fundamental concepts and techniques of model selection in the context of phylogenetics. We start by reviewing different aspects of the selection of substitution models in phylogenetics from a theoretical, philosophical and practical point of view, and summarize this comparison in table format. We argue that the most commonly implemented model selection approach, the hierarchical likelihood ratio test, is not the optimal strategy for model selection in phylogenetics, and that approaches like the Akaike Information Criterion ( AIC) and Bayesian methods offer important advantages. In particular, the latter two methods are able to simultaneously compare multiple nested or nonnested models, assess model selection uncertainty, and allow for the estimation of phylogenies and model parameters using all available models ( model-averaged inference or multimodel inference). We also describe how the relative importance of the different parameters included in substitution models can be depicted. To illustrate some of these points, we have applied AIC-based model averaging to 37 mitochondrial DNA sequences from the subgenus Ohomopterus ( genus Carabus) ground beetles described by Sota and Vogler ( 2001).},

abstract = {Schistosomiasis mansoni is a parasitic disease resulting in the deposition of ova predominantly in the liver and intestines. These ova secrete antigens which induce host sensitization and evoke focal granulomas. The granulomas are intricate delayed-hypersensitivity reactions governed by numerous cellular and humoral interactions. They displace or destroy normal tissue. Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) is one of several neuropeptides which exert a broad range of biologic actions that may include modulation of immune responses. In this study, VIP was sought within liver granulomas isolated from Schistosoma mansoni-infected, CBA/J mice. Granuloma extracts contained appreciable amounts of immunoreactive VIP as detected by radioimmunoassay. Immunoreactive VIP was shown, by each of two chromatographic methods, to elute as a single peak coinciding with that of synthetic VIP. In situ hybridization was performed with an oligonucleotide probe complementary to a portion of the nucleotide sequence encoding VIP on preproVIP mRNA (antisense probe). Radiolabeled VIP probe adhered exclusively to granuloma eosinophils and to eosinophils within a peritonitis induced in normal mice by proteose peptone. Hybridization of radiolabeled VIP probe in the presence of unlabeled probe substantially attenuated binding. A sense probe failed to bind. These data suggest that the granulomas contain authentic VIP and that eosinophils express the gene for this molecule.},

Tagged dusky sharks all migrated westward and across the Great Australian Bight (GAB) during autumn to offshore shelf waters off Western Australia. Estimated minimum distances travelled ranged from 1760 to 2736 km. Depths occupied by tagged dusky sharks ranged from the surface to 355 m. The most common thermal ranges occupied were 19-22°C.

abstract = {ABSTRACT This study examines life history patterns and correlations between traits related to body size, reproduction, age, and growth in sharks, using data from 230 populations representing 164 species, 19 families, and 7 orders. The analysis focused on interspecific life history variability, but intraspecific and intrapopulation variation were also considered. Interspecifically, body size correlated positively with litter size and offspring size, and a tradeoff between litter size and offspring size was found after factoring out the effects of body size. Offspring size correlated negatively with growth completion rate (K), but the correlation became positive after correcting for the effects of body size. Parental size for males and females was negatively correlated with K. Parental size and size at maturity exhibited a strong positive correlation, with sexual maturity occurring at about 75{\%} of maximum size in both sexes. Males were 10{\%} smaller than females and reached their maximum length 34{\%} faster than females on average. Females tend to mature later and live longer than males, but age at maturity is reached at about 50{\%} of maximum age in both sexes. Maximum size and empirical longevity were not significantly correlated in females, but were positively correlated in males. Size and age at maturity also exhibited a moderate positive correlation in males, especially after excluding data for Squalus acanthias. Principal component and cluster analyses were used to reflect similarities among life history traits of 40 populations from 34 species, and at least three separate life history strategies were identified.},

abstract = {Knowledge of movement patterns of sharks in coastal waters is critical for the structuring of regional management plans. Through a long-term tag–recapture program, 9716 dusky sharks (Carcharhinus obscurus) were tagged and released along the east coast of South Africa. A total of 648 C. obscurus, principally small sharks ({\textless}100 cm PCL), were recaptured. Most recaptures were within 100 km of the tagging location in the nursery habitat in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) with small scale movements occurring throughout the year. Forty-eight C. obscurus undertook movements {\textgreater}200 km that indicated a southerly migration between KZN and Eastern/Southern Cape (E/SC) between June and November. Seasonal northerly migrations were less well defined. The largest southerly and northerly movements were 1323 km and 1374 km, respectively. For sharks moving 1–100 km south from their tagging locality in KZN, an increase in displacement occurred between June and September identifying animals beginning their migration to the E/SC. With increasing displacement, there was also an increase in minimum swimming speed. Calculated growth rates of small sharks of 10.3–11.5 cm year–1 were in agreement with current literature values. Established tag–recapture programs provide an important tool in understanding the ecology of early life-stages of coastal shark species.},

The average distance travelled by maturing and adult sharks was 342 km (95{\%} CI = 275–409 km). One female shark, however, was recaptured 1897 km from its original release site. The average rate at which pregnant sharks moved south from their gestation to pupping grounds was 2.6 km day–1 (95{\%} CI = 2.04–3.16 km day–1).

abstract = {Marine protected areas (MPAs) are commonly employed to protect ecosystems from threats like overfishing. Ideally, MPA design should incorporate movement data from multiple target species to ensure sufficient habitat is protected. We used long-term acoustic telemetry and network analysis to determine the fine-scale space use of five shark and one turtle species at a remote atoll in the Seychelles, Indian Ocean, and evaluate the efficacy of a proposed MPA. Results revealed strong, species-specific habitat use in both sharks and turtles, with corresponding variation in MPA use. Defining the MPA's boundary from the edge of the reef flat at low tide instead of the beach at high tide (the current best in Seychelles) significantly increased the MPA's coverage of predator movements by an average of 34{\%}. Informed by these results, the larger MPA was adopted by the Seychelles government, demonstrating how telemetry data can improve shark spatial conservation by affecting policy directly.},

abstract = {New technologies have vastly increased the available data on animal movement and behaviour. Consequently, new methods deciphering the spatial and temporal interactions between individuals and their environments are vital. Network analyses offer a powerful suite of tools to disentangle the complexity within these dynamic systems, and we review these tools, their application, and how they have generated new ecological and behavioural insights. We suggest that network theory can be used to model and predict the influence of ecological and environmental parameters on animal movement, focusing on spatial and social connectivity, with fundamental implications for conservation. Refining how we construct and randomise spatial networks at different temporal scales will help to establish network theory as a prominent, hypothesis-generating tool in movement ecology.},

Historically species fished by TDGDLF - slow increase in 50s to 70s, rapid increase 80s, peak in late 80s/early 90s. At this point, management was introduced, with surveys/on-board observations starting 1993. Daily catch logs introduced in 06/07. 

Depth trends - FL increased with depth in dusky but decreased in depth with sandbar - could indicate adult sandbars are more coastal than dusky.

Species core distribution (as defined in this study) south of 28S and 113-120E for dusky, south of 26S and 113-118E for Sandbar.

Dusky and Sandbar more heavily fished than Gummy or Whiskery - catch data between 93-13.

Sandbar and Dusky - longer lived shark species.

Found little change in average weight of individuals over time, fluctuation in dusky and slight increase in sandbar - decline would indicate overexploitation. Evidence of sustainable fishing practices.

Sandbars more common in N latitudes and TDGDLF operate S of Ningaloo and only caught in S during summer and autumn when temperatures are higher. NSF had very high catched of sandbars in late 90s - early 00s but fishing stopped in 2008/09. Could explain increase in sandbar size as not exploited in winter range.},

abstract = {Understanding animal movement decisions that involve migration is critical for evaluating population connectivity, and thus persistence. Recent work on sharks has shown that often only a portion of the adult population will undertake migrations, while the rest may be resident in an area for long periods. Defining the extent to which adult sharks use specific habitats and their migratory behaviour is essential for assessing their risk of exposure to threats such as fishing and habitat degradation. The present study used acoustic telemetry to examine residency patterns and migratory behaviour of adult bull sharks (Carcharhinus leucas) along the East coast of Australia. Fifty-six VR2W acoustic receivers were used to monitor the movements of 33 bull sharks in the central Great Barrier Reef (GBR). Both males and females were detected year-round, but their abundance and residency peaked between September and December across years (2012-2014). High individual variability in reef use patterns was apparent, with some individuals leaving the array for long periods, whereas others (36{\%}) exhibited medium (0.20-0.40) or high residency ({\textgreater} 0.50). A large portion of the population (51{\%}) undertook migrations of up to 1,400 km to other coral reefs and/or inshore coastal habitats in Queensland and New South Wales. Most of these individuals (76{\%}) were mature females, and the timing of migrations coincided with the austral summer (Dec-Feb). All migrating individuals (except one) returned to the central GBR, highlighting its importance as a potential foraging ground. Our findings suggest that adult bull sharks appear to be highly dependent on coral reef resources and provide evidence of partial migration, where only a portion of the female population undertook seasonal migrations potentially to give birth. Given that estuarine habitats face constant anthropogenic pressures, understanding partial migration and habitat connectivity of large coastal predators should be a priority for their management.},

abstract = {Knowledge of the broad-scale movement patterns of sharks is essential to developing effective management strategies. Currently there is a large bias in studies focusing on species that are either large apex predators or found in tropical to subtropical regions. There is limited knowledge of the movements and migrations of benthic and temperate shark species. The present study used passive acoustic telemetry to investigate the movement patterns of a benthic shark species, the Port Jackson shark (Heterodontus portusjacksoni). Individuals were tagged with acoustic transmitters between 2012 and 2014 and their movements were monitored within Jervis Bay and along the east Australian coastline for up to 4 years. Male and female Port Jackson sharks demonstrated high levels of philopatry to both Jervis Bay and their tagging location across multiple years. Although males and females did not differ in their arrival times, females departed from Jervis Bay later than males. Approximately half the tagged individuals migrated in a southward direction, with individuals being detected at Narooma, Bass Strait and Cape Barron Island. This study provides conclusive evidence of bisexual philopatry in a benthic temperate shark species, confirming previous hypotheses, and presents the most detailed migration route},

abstract = {Global declines of shark populations are of concern because of their largely assumed role as moderators of ecosystem function. Without long-term data on movement patterns for many species, it is impossible to infer relative extinction risk, which varies as a function of range, dispersal and habitat specificity and use. The past 50 yr of research on coastal sharks has revealed common movement patterns among species. In the horizontal plane, measured home range size generally increases with body size. We demonstrate meta-analytically the effects of increasing body size and monitoring time on home range size. Changes in the extent of horizontal movement might arise from ontogeny, predator avoidance or environmental tolerances. In the vertical plane, movement patterns include oscillatory vertical displacement, surface swimming, diel vertical migration and swimming at depth. These vertical movements are often attributed to foraging or navigation, but have been quantified less than horizontal patterns. Habitat specificity is often correlated with environmental conditions such as depth, salinity, substratum, and in some cases, prey availability. Site fidelity is common in species that use nursery areas. However, fidelity to mating, pupping, feeding and natal sites has only been observed in a few species. To date, few studies have examined habitat partitioning, although some general patterns have emerged: habitats appear to be subdivided by benthos type, prey availability and depth. The conservation of coastal sharks can be facilitated in some cases by the use of marine protected areas, especially for coastal resident species using specific nursery, reproduction or feeding areas. Partial protected-area closures might be effective during aggregation or migration periods to protect older size classes, but these must be applied with other management strategies such as reduced fishing and size or bag limits to protect individuals throughout different life history phases. More long-term research on habitat use, migration patterns and habitat partitioning is essential for developing successful management initiatives for coastal shark populations.},

Sandbar C. plum - beus, gummy Mustelus antarcticus and particularly whiskery Furgaleus macki sharks were less mobile but can still move over long distances. The proportion of monitored time within different fisheries management zones varied among species. Dusky sharks showed the highest interconnectivity among these zones, reflecting the high mobility and complex movement patterns of this species.

Large-scale movements are increasingly being reported for sharks and rays. Hence, in this review we summarise the current understanding of long-scale movement patterns of sharks and rays and then present the different methods used in fisheries science for modelling population movement with an emphasis on sharks and rays. The use of movement data for informing population modelling and deriving man- agement advice remains rare for sharks and rays. In the few cases where population movement was modelled explicitly, movement information has been solely derived from conventional tagging. Though shark and ray movement has been increasingly studied through a range of approaches these different sources of infor- mation have not been used in population models. Integrating these multiple sources of movement information could advance our understanding of shark and ray dynamics. This, in turn, would allow the use of more adequate models for assessing stocks and advising management and conservation effort.},

abstract = {Accurate assessment of shark population status is essential for conservation but is often constrained by limited and unreliable data. To provide a basis for improved management of shark resources, we analyzed a long-term record of species-specific catches, sizes, and sexes of sharks collected by onboard observers in the western and central Pacific Ocean from 1995 to 2010. Using generalized linear models, we estimated population-status indicators on the basis of catch rate and biological indicators of fishing pressure on the basis of median size to identify trends for blue (Prionace glauca), mako (Isurus spp.), oceanic whitetip (Carcharhinus longimanus), and silky (Carcharhinus falciformis) sharks. Standardized catch rates of longline fleets declined significantly for blue sharks in the North Pacific (by 5{\%} per year [CI 2{\%} to 8{\%}]), for mako sharks in the North Pacific (by 7{\%} per year [CI 3{\%} to 11{\%}]), and for oceanic whitetip sharks in tropical waters (by 17{\%} per year [CI 14{\%} to 20{\%}]). Median lengths of silky and oceanic whitetip sharks decreased significantly in their core habitat, and almost all sampled silky sharks were immature. Our results are consistent with results of analyses of similar data sets. Combined, these results and evidence of targeted fishing for sharks in some regional fisheries heighten concerns for sustainable utilization, particularly for oceanic whitetip and North Pacific blue sharks. Regional regulations that prohibit shark finning (removal of fins and discarding of the carcass) were enacted in 2007 and are in many cases the only form of control on shark catches. However, there is little evidence of a reduction of finning in longline fisheries. In addition, silky and oceanic whitetip sharks are more frequently retained than finned, which suggests that even full implementation of and adherence to a finning prohibition may not substantially reduce mortality rates for these species. We argue that finning prohibitions divert attention from assessing whether catch levels are sustainable and that the need for management of sharks should not be addressed by measures that are simple to implement but complex to enforce and evaluate.},

We make the first assessment of global stock structure of C. obscurus by analyzing part of the mitochondrial control region (mtCR) in 255 individuals sampled from 8 geographically dispersed locations. We found 25 mtCR haplotypes and rejected a null hypothesis of panmixia (analysis of molecular variance, $\Phi$ST = 0.55, p {\textless} 0.000001), detecting significant differentiation between 3 management units: US Atlantic (USATL), South Africa (SAF), and Australia (AUS). We also found preliminary evidence of population structure between the USATL and southwest Atlantic (Brazil). There were no shared haplotypes between the western Atlantic and Indo-Pacific. These analyses suggest that replenishment of the collapsed USATL management unit via immigration of females from elsewhere is unlikely. Mixed stock analysis (MSA) simulations show that reconstruction of the relative contributions of USATL, SAF, and AUS management units to the Asian fin trade is possible using these mtCR sequences.

abstract = {A method for studying animal movements based on data from independent data-logging acoustic receivers is described. The method takes presence or absence data from multiple receivers arranged in an array and converts them to position estimates based on weighted means of the number of signal receptions at each receiver during a specified time period. The method is equivalent to a short-term center of activity rather than a precise estimate of location at a single time. The utility of the method was assessed using data from a study of neonate blacktip sharks (Carcharhinus limbatus). Periods between 5 and 60 min were tested to find the most appropriate interval for estimating positions. The results from the method agreed closely with a simulated shark track and data from actively tracked sharks. The median distances between successive locations from the mean-position algorithm were between 28{\%} and 42{\%} of those from active tracking because of the center-of-activity nature of the method. The results presented demonstrate that the technique provides a useful method for investigating long-term movement patterns, space utilization patterns over broader areas, and home range.},

Network theory aka graph theory
Social network analysis

Sharks - slow growth, low fecundity, wide ranging and cryptic behaviour so difficult to study - especially socially.

Questions:
Do sharks have preferential social partners?
Are shark groups assorted by phenotypic traits? and by spatial and temporal scales?
Can sharks learn from social partners?

Analysis now more possible due to computing

Main principles of network application in sharks:
1. social networks - how, why, who
2. spatial networks - linking discrete locations through individual movement
Not mutually exclusive.

Network Theory:

Directed networks - interactions such as dominance or movement - in adjacency matrix only one entry, non-symmetrical matrix.

Undirected networks - symmetrical matrices - illustrate interactions in both directions.

Can for example look at importance of individual members of a population. 

Node degree - when weighted can id individuals based upon number of interactions. Binary directed networks - in and outward movements accounted as well. Understanding relative importance of individuals. Also useful for central locations and help id where to protect for conservation.

Groups of closely connected nodes - community or cliques. Social and spatial interaction closely intertwined.

Bimodel - two sets of nodes from different clases compared.

Gaussian mixture modelling - structure for likely clusters and time-series of tag detections.},

abstract = {Many shark species are at risk of overexploitation due to their high economic value, slow maturation, and low recruitment compared to most teleosts. However, there is insufficient knowledge about population structure at different spatial scales necessary to optimise fisheries models. We used single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) obtained through complexity-reduction genome sequencing to quantify the population structure of two highly mobile and commercially fished shark species: bronze whalers (Carcharhinus brachyurus) and dusky sharks (C. obscurus). We applied a comprehensive approach to test several population-structure hypotheses and signal consistency across methods and marker type. We found that C. obscurus was panmictic across Australia and Indonesia and across the Indian Ocean to South Africa based on neutral loci, whereas for C. brachyurus, the westernmost Australian samples appeared to be separate from the rest. The southernmost east Australian samples indicated some difference from the rest of Australia and New Zealand based on candidate loci for C. brachyurus, and potentially also C. obscurus; however, the lack of a reference genome makes the interpretation difficult. Despite similar patterns in both species, subtle and potentially important structure differences emphasise the importance of studying each target species independently rather than assuming similar patterns from closely related species with similar dispersal abilities, as well as considering different marker types in future studies. We found evidence of connectivity across the regions sampled, suggesting that the cumulative effects of regional fisheries and the potential for cross-jurisdictional fishery assessments and management should be considered for Australian, Indonesian, and New Zealand populations.},

annote = {Methods - locations of recievers and tagging - receivers located in Ningaloo reef in NW and Recherche Archipelago off SW coast. Approx 430 receivers deployed. See report for data recovery methods from receivers. Shark tagging occurred between may 2011 and aug 2013 on 6 occasions and several opportunisic sampling days during receiver maintenance cruises in S.WA 2012-2013. Sharks selected for vigor and absence of obvious injuries post capture to increase survival likelihood. Each tag has unique number, implanted into abdominal cavities via small incision anterior to pelvic girdle by experienced taggers. Also fitted with Jumbo Rototags on 1st dorsal fin for visual ID - yellow to distinguish acoustically tagged sharks as opposed to conventional orange. Info given to fisheries and DoF offices for recapture data. Less than 10 acoustic tags returned due to recapture and processing by commercial fisheries. All sharks prior to release measured - FL, sexed, location and time of release noted. Shark detections assumed within 400-500m of receivers. Found that the sharks behaved randomly therefore mixed effects models not required. Tags female dominated. Advantageous as do not depend upon recapture.

TDGDLF - temperate demersal gillnet and demersal longline fisheries - of regional importance for employment, food and income. Primarily target gummy sharks on the south coast, dusky along the south and west, and sandbar sharks along the west coast. Whiskery also caught and targeted in all three zones. Fisheries in 13/14 accounted for 190t dusky and 45t sandbar caught, higher previously with up to 585 and 235t respectively, with net mesh sizes limiting catch to dusky {\textless}2yrs and sandbar 6-9yrs. 

Low numbers of take also occur in commercial and recreational fishing. Recreational popular but reliable estimates of take not available as ID not reliable + most thought to be returned live. Commercially - likely to come into contact with others due to broad ranges but also difficult to quantify. Other non-AU fisheries may enter waters and also take - unquantified, e.g. Indonesia - mid risk for Dusky. For Sandbar risk is higher as more northerly distribution, higher fin value and smaller size, however unlikely to lead to widespread depletion.

Three management zones S of Ningaloo - JASDGDLF (Joint Authority Southern...) split into Zone 1 and Zone 2 (Z2 extends to border with SA), and WCDGDLF (West Coast...). Management strategies differ in each zone. North of Ningaloo closure = WANCSF (WA N. Coast Shark Fishery) and JANSF (Joint Authority Northern Shark Fishery) which operated until 2009 and did target shark species including study species.

Stock analyses indicate that catches of larger fish, adults and subadults, can decline with very small rises in catch rate over sustainable (1-2{\%}). Recruitment declines in 90s/00s likely through unidentified gillnet catch in duskys. Sandbar breeding stocks depleted by longlines 97-05 off North coast. Removals of younger life stages less damaging.

Management - large area closure in ningaloo, commercial protection of sharks and rays, max size limits ({\textgreater}70cm dorsal fin) for dusky, gear restrictions. Seasonal closures currently in effect. Need to minimise further adult fish mortality. Movement and migration patterns uncertain therefore hinder sustainability efforts (Clear migratory displacements in dusky sharks north to south). Shark fishing prohibited in the North-West since 1993 to protect adult dusky and sandbar sharks, closed in 2009, if reopened would pose threat to both species, and juv./subadult stages in sandbars also as not so coastal. Still vulnerable in the southerly range but little known about movements, migration causes issues. Met. Perth also closed off since 2007 under 250m between 31S and 33S. Sharks with inter-dorsal fin {\textgreater} 70cm protected since 2006, and must be released upon capture. 1/3 WCDGDLF removed. Due to lower effort, net entanglements less likely.

Risk analysis - used consequence likelihood method, examining source, consequences, likelihood of each. 

Coastal and offshore development - increase in human population = loss of habitat and degredation/increased fishing pressure for food. Oil and gas exploration/drilling (happening in N) also a potential threat. Wide ranging generalists therefore less likely to be effected by development.

Increasing temperature - may alter currents, for example Leeuwin Current that alters temp of much of WA waters, altering distributions of species therefore changing conditions could effect future distributions.

Ecology - spatial distribution of both species includes life stage spatial separation which are vulnerable to different threats. Here adult is defined as age classes above age at 50{\%} maturity (see figure 21). Dusky = born waters S Abrolhos Islands Feb-June and variable location, not nursery, so less likely to get picked up on mass. Dusky juv. habitat = inshore cont. shelf {\textless}100m, gradual NW movement and movement offshore therefore decreased risk with age as TDFDLF usually {\textless}100m. Sandbar 12month gestation, 40-45cm at birth, suggestions coastal nurseries not used. Sandbar also move up west coast as grow, no evidence of migration n-s yet.

204 (dusky = 103, sandbar = 101) acoustic tags, most adult or juvenile - therefore detailed understanding of life histories, which is difficult to obtain through fisheries as adults reside outside commercial fishing areas, adults are rare and rarely captured, and dusky are protected from commercial fisheries.

2 of the most commercially important species

Dusky - move furthest and larger individuals showed NS displacement, evidence from other populations in AU, MX and SAfr. North in winter and spring, south in summer and autumn. May support 2year cycle hyp. Not all females undertake migration despite being large enough.

Sandbar - mostly Northern range, individuals have v. different behavioural patterns. Lack of pattern = more difficult to manage. In N Ameerica long distance migrations along E coast (Gulf of Mex. - New Jersey).

Juveniles tend to remain in temperate waters for several years and migrate north to join breeding stock.},
