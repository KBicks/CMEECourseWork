abstract = {{\textcopyright} Inter-Research 2017. Information on broad-scale movements is required for spatial management and improved conservation of large marine predators. We studied the mobility of the 4 most commercially important shark species of Western Australia (WA) using a network of acoustic receivers. Dusky sharks Carcharhinus obscurus showed very high mobility across WA. Sandbar C. plum - beus, gummy Mustelus antarcticus and particularly whiskery Furgaleus macki sharks were less mobile but can still move over long distances. The proportion of monitored time within different fisheries management zones varied among species. Dusky sharks showed the highest interconnectivity among these zones, reflecting the high mobility and complex movement patterns of this species. Sandbar, gummy and whiskery sharks followed, showing less movement among zones. Our study demonstrates how acoustic telemetry can be used to determine the movement patterns of species at the scale of fisheries management and therefore contribute to improved management and sustainability.},
annote = {Use of acoustic telemetry to manage species as the scale required to impact fishery management.

Motivation - hard to study movement of marine organisms - e.g. large marine predators. Understanding required to manage populations.

Shark fisheries - 4 species make up about 80{\%} of catch in gillnets and longlines

Sustainable harvest set but information gaps - due to temp and spatial distributions being very important to the species.

Movement patterns the least understood part of their ecology - issues with sustainability. 

Maintain recruitment - Ningaloo closed to protect species, historically gummy and whiskery sharks overfished.

Dusky sharks more mobile in terms of distance travelled. Potentially due to larger size

Sandbar less mobile. Adults more abundant further north and juveniles in deeper water to the south - remain in temperate waters then migrate when older to join breeding stock, and migrate south to give birth. Those in N america much more migratory. 

Whiskery sharks stayed in array - minimal movement.

Migrations lead into commercial fishing grounds.},

abstract = {1. Determining how animals move within their environment is a fundamental knowledge that con- tributes to effective management and conservation. Continuous round-the-clock animal move- ment data are frequently gathered using biotelemetry technology, providing discrete data packages on the presenceabsence of animals at known locations through time. Current analyses of such data do not generally account for the interconnectivity of locations as animals move between them and consequently do not integrate graphically or statistically a temporal component to spatial changes. 2. Here, we describe the novel application of network analyses to electronic tag data whereby nodes represent locations and edges of the movements of individuals. We demonstrate some of the descriptive and quantitative approaches for determining how an animals movement interconnects home range habitats. Telemetry data from arrays of recorders provide movement data of individ- ual animals, and as examples of the method proposed, we examine the movements of two distinct shark species, the small-spotted catshark (Scyliorhinus canicula) and the Caribbean reef shark (Carcharhinus perezi). In doing so, we consider both local and global network properties from an animal movement perspective and simulate the effects of node disruption as a proxy for habitat disturbance. 3. Comparative visual representations of two catshark movement networks suggest, for example, potential differences in space use. Multiple regression quadratic assignment procedure shows that habitat is a significant predictor ofmovement behaviour. 4. Null modelling of C. perezi movement data, corrected for the spatial restriction of static nodes, demonstrated a significant, non-random distribution of directed movements among sites. Additionally, the connectivity of this animals movement network is significantly reduced through targeted disruption of a site of high centrality but not through disruption of a randomly selected site. 5. Network theory is a well-established theoretical framework and its integration into the fast developing field of animal movement and telemetry might improve significantly how we interpret animal space use from electronically recorded data. This technique has potentially wide application in animal behaviour but may also inform the management of habitat harbouring threatened or endangered species via the simulation, modelling and intuitive visualisation of animal movement interactions.},

abstract = {New technologies have vastly increased the available data on animal movement and behaviour. Consequently, new methods deciphering the spatial and temporal interactions between individuals and their environments are vital. Network analyses offer a powerful suite of tools to disentangle the complexity within these dynamic systems, and we review these tools, their application, and how they have generated new ecological and behavioural insights. We suggest that network theory can be used to model and predict the influence of ecological and environmental parameters on animal movement, focusing on spatial and social connectivity, with fundamental implications for conservation. Refining how we construct and randomise spatial networks at different temporal scales will help to establish network theory as a prominent, hypothesis-generating tool in movement ecology.},
