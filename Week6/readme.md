### CMEE Coursework Week 6 README

*Introduction:* This directory contains coursework files from week 6 of the CMEE course. This week covered genomics and bioinformatics, but used a virtual machine so generate no code files, and all data was too large to put under version control, therefore the directories are empty, and purely here for structure. I hope you enjoy my excellent use of markdown to maintain directory structure.

*Contents:* There are three directories:
1. **Code** 
2. **Data** 
3. **Results**
