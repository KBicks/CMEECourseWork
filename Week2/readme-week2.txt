CMEE Course Work Week 2 Directory

This directory contains four directories:
    1. Code
    2. Data
    3. Results
    4. Sandbox

The Code contains python code files as described:
    .py scripts are python code files
    basic_io.py demonstrates data outputs, inputs and storage in python
    basic_csv.py demonstrates manipulation, including subsetting, of csv files
    
    boilerplate.py demonstrates use of functions to write a program that can 
    be imported as a module and run as a script
    using_name.py demonstrates use of setting __name__ variable to __"main"__ to
    allow the program to run itself and be imported as a module
    sysargv.py uses the sys module to output information about the script
    scopy.py demonstrates that variables only act within a function unless set as 
    global.

    control_flow.py, cfexercises1.py and cfexercises2.py demonstrate use of 
    control variables.
    test_control_flow.py shows how to use doctest to test functions

    loops.py demonstrates the use of FOR loops and WHILE loops
    oaks.py shows how list comprehensions can be used instead of loops

    Practical tasks:
    lc1.py and lc2.py show use of list comprehensions and for loops for subsetting
    data from sets
    dictionary.py demonstrates how to populate a dictionary from a set
    tuple.py shows how to extract data and print from tuples
    align_seqs.py takes a csv input sequence and matches two sequences, counts the
    number of matches, then outputs the sequences with the highest number of
    matches into a txt file in results, with the number of matches.
    oaks_debugme.py searches input csv for oak species and outputs them into a new
    csv file in results.

The Data directory contains files for testing the code scripts.
The Results directory contains the outputs from code scripts.
The Sandbox directory contains practise and test files.
