This directory contains four directories:

    2. Data
    3. Results
    4. Sandbox

The Code contains python code files as described:
    .py scripts are python code files
    basic_io.py demonstrates data outputs, inputs and storage in python
    basic_csv.py demonstrates manipulation, including subsetting, of csv files
    
    boilerplate.py demonstrates use of functions to write a program that can 
    be imported as a module and run as a script
    user_name.py demonstrates use of setting __name__ variable to __"main"__ to
    allow the program to run itself and be imported as a module

The Data directory contains files for testing the code scripts.
The Results directory contains the outputs from code scripts.
The Sandbox directory contains practise and test files.
