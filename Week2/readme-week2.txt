CMEE Course Work Week 2 Directory

This directory contains four directories:
    1. Code
    2. Data
    3. Results
    4. Sandbox

The Code contains python code files as described:
    .py scripts are python code files
    basic_io.py demonstrates data outputs, inputs and storage in python
    basic_csv.py demonstrates manipulation, including subsetting, of csv files
    
    boilerplate.py demonstrates use of functions to write a program that can 
    be imported as a module and run as a script
    using_name.py demonstrates use of setting __name__ variable to __"main"__ to
    allow the program to run itself and be imported as a module
    sysargv.py uses the sys module to output information about the script
    scopy.py demonstrates that variables only act within a function unless set as 
    global.

    control_flow.py, cfexercises1.py and cfexercises2.py demonstrate use of 
    control variables.
    loops.py demonstrates the use of FOR loops and WHILE loops

The Data directory contains files for testing the code scripts.
The Results directory contains the outputs from code scripts.
The Sandbox directory contains practise and test files.
