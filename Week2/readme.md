### CMEE Coursework Week 2 README

*Introduction:* This directory contains coursework files from week 2 of the CMEE course. This week included an introduction to python, and applications described in the scripts below.
  
    
*Contents:* There are four directories:
1. **Code** - script files in python.
2. **Data** - data used to test script files and referred to within some scripts.
3. **Results** - location for output files produced by script files.
4. **Sandbox** - practise and test files.
  
  
*Code File Descriptions:*  
Biological computing in Python 1:  
**basic_io.py** - Demonstrates inputing text files into python: File Input prints first every line in a file, then every line apart from blank lines, File Output generates a list of a specified range, then saves it with each element on a new line, Storing Files using the pickle module.  
**basic_csv.py** - Reads and prints a csv file, then writes specified components of the csv to a new csv.  
**boilerplate.py** - Boilerplate script to demonstrate how to write functions in python.  
**using_name.py** - Demonstration of using __name__==__"main"__ to write a program that can run itself, and be imported by another module.  
**sysargv.py** - Using module sys, gives name, number of arguments and lists arguments of a script.  
**scope.py** - Demonstrates that global variables appear outside the function, whereas variables set inside the function do not alter variables outside the function.  
**control_flow,py** - Demonstrating the use of control statements.  
**cfexercises1.py** - Demonstration of different control functions.  
**loops.py** - Demonstration of for loops and while loops.  
**oaks.py** - Demonstrates how list for loops and list comprehensions can be used for the same tasks - outputing oak species from list and changing output to upper case.  
**test_control_flow.py** - Functions exemplifying the use of control statements.  
**debugme.py** - Code with error to practise debugging.  
  
Biological computing in Python 1 Practicals:  
**cfexercises2.py** - Demonstrates definition of functions using if statements and for loops, includes test values.  
**lc1.py** - Exemplifies use of list comprehensions and conventional loops to subset information from a list.  
**lc2.py** - Exemplifies use of list comprehensions and for loops to manipulate tuples.  
**dictionary.py** - Populate a dictionary with order as the key, and each species sorted into order.  
**tuple.py** - Print each tuple on a separate line.  
**align_seqs.py** - Ouput the two DNA sequences with the highest number of matches, with their number of matches, from a csv.  
**oaks_debugme.py** - Finds oak species from a csv file and output these into a new csv file of oak species only.
