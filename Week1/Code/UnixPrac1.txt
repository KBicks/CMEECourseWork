#1 Count number of lines in each file
wc -l ../Data/{407228326.fasta,407228412.fasta,E.coli.fasta}
# where wc gives counts of a file, and -l specifies to count only number of lines

#2 Print everything starting from the second line 
tail -n +2 ../Data/E.coli.fasta
# tail prints the last lines of a file, and -n +2 specifies to start from the second line

#3 Count the sequence length of this genome
tail -n +2 ../Data/E.coli.fasta | wc -m
# still excluding the first line, wc -m counts the number of characters

#4 Count the matches of sequence "ATGC" in the genome of E.coli
tail -n +2 ../Data/E.coli.fasta | tr -d "\n" | grep -o "ATGC" | wc -l
# grep finds the occurences of the sequence in the file, and wc -l counts the number of occurences 

#5 Compute the AT/GC ratio
